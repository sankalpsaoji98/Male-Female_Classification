## Introduction

The Male-Female Classification Project uses machine learning techniques to classify images of male and female faces. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build a robust and accurate gender classification model.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies images into male and female categories.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification.
- **Training and Inference**: Provides scripts for training the model and classifying new images.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
